# Deepfake Sentinel

Deepfake Sentinel is a cross-modal desktop monitoring service that continuously watches video sources (folder drops, screen capture, webcam) and audio streams to detect AI-generated content in real-time. It leverages deep learning models for both video and speech, logs all detections, issues live desktop notifications, and provides a Streamlit dashboard for reviewing alerts. Built with end-to-end MLOps in mind, it features data ingestion, model training, serving, logging, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker-based deployment on Linux.

# üöÄ MVP Features

Below are the core MVP features and their current status (Sprint¬†1 in progress):

- Initialize repo structure & CI templates (GitHub Actions for lint/test) -> In Progress
- Configure local MLflow server & logging -> In Progress
- Data EDA & preprocessing notebooks (FaceForensics++ video) -> In Progress
- Data EDA & preprocessing notebooks (ASVspoof audio) -> In Progress
- 
- Baseline PyTorch training scripts (video & audio) -> Planned
- Hyperparameter tuning integration (Optuna) -> Planned
- FastAPI detection services for video & audio -> Planned
- Folder watcher & screen grabber ingestion services -> Planned
- Audio listener ingestion service -> Planned
- Detection result logging & Linux desktop notifications -> Planned
- Streamlit dashboard for real-time alerts -> Planned
- Dockerization & CI/CD pipeline setup ->  Planned

# CI/CD
### Continuous Integration (CI)
Automatically runs on every push or pull request to main.
- Checkout code
- Install dependencies (from requirements.txt)
- Lint the codebase (flake8 src tests)
- Run unit tests (pytest)
- Smoke-test notebooks or model-training scripts
### Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)
- Builds and packages your services once CI passes:
- Builds Docker images for the Video and Audio FastAPI services
- Pushes them to Docker Hub or GitHub Packages
- Automates local ‚Äúdeploy‚Äù via docker-compose up in your CI pipeline for integration tests

# üõ† Post-MVP Feature Ideas

- Detection Accuracy
- Cross-modal fusion of audio + video confidences
- Ensemble of multiple deepfake detectors
- Model drift detection & scheduled retraining
- Performance & Scale
- GPU acceleration with TorchScript/ONNX + CUDA
- High-frame-rate real-time screen capture
- Batch-mode processing of archived video files
- Platform Support
- Windows & macOS native installers (NSIS, pkgbuild)
- Android companion app or background service
- Browser extension to flag deepfakes on web pages
- UI/UX Enhancements
- React-based dashboard with filter/search & history playback
- Electron wrapper for a native desktop application
- Email / Slack alerts for high-severity detections
- Monitoring & Metrics
- Prometheus exporter & Grafana dashboard for system metrics
- Log aggregation (ELK Stack or Loki)
- Usage analytics (e.g., which detectors trigger most frequently)
- Auto-Updates & Operations
- Auto-update logic: check for new models and download automatically
- Automated package builds on Docker Hub / GitHub Packages with release tags

Feature ideas above are intended for v2.0 and beyond. The initial 3‚Äëmonth MVP focuses on core detection, notifications, and dashboard functionality.
